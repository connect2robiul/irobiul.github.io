## Open to work 

I am actively seeking a post-doctoral position at a prestigious university to advance my research in computational pragmatics and artificial intelligence. I am dedicated to leveraging my academic background and research expertise to contribute to innovative studies, collaborate with esteemed faculty, and mentor graduate students. 

I’m an aspiring academic with lots of experience teaching and researching computer science. I recently finished my Аспирантура equivalent to Ph.D. in Computer Science and Information Processes at Innopolis University in Russia. My research focused on analyzing how the brain processes sensor information using EEG.
While I was doing my PhD, I also worked as a teaching assistant at Innopolis University. This was a great chance for me to develop my teaching skills and create some lab slides for courses in logic, discrete mathematics, neuroscience and theoretical computer science. I’ve also taught at Khwaja Yunus Ali University in Bangladesh.
My research has been published in some great places, like IEEE Access, Procedia Computer Science, Mathematics, and The Visual Computer. I’ve also presented my work at international conferences like the Fifth Scientific School "Dynamics of Complex Networks and their Applications" (DCNA'2021).
I’m now looking to apply my skills and experience to a faculty member or research fellow position at a top academic institution. I’m passionate about developing innovative curricula, fostering student engagement, and advancing research in areas such as computational pragmatics and artificial intelligence.
If you have any suitable openings or would like to discuss potential opportunities, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I’d love the chance to contribute to your organization and collaborate with your team.

Je suis à la recherche d'un poste de post-doctorant dans une université renommée afin d'approfondir mes recherches dans le domaine de la pragmatique informatique et de l'intelligence artificielle. Je m'engage à mettre à profit ma formation universitaire et mon expertise en matière de recherche pour contribuer à des études novatrices, collaborer avec d'éminents professeurs et encadrer des étudiants de troisième cycle.

Feel free to connect if you know of any opportunities or if you would like to discuss potential collaborations!
